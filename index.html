It was erected to commemorate the landing in December 1911 at Wellington Pier, Mumbai of King-Emperor George V and Queen-Empress Mary, the first British monarch to visit India. At the time of the royal visit, the gateway was not yet built, and a cardboard structure greeted the monarch.</p>

                <p>Bottom Line: The film will bring back the magic for your t(w)een, who was a fan of the original. But, it could be too intense for preschoolers. There are some spoilers below in the full review. Full Review: While it had some great songs, and I thought better instrumental music, I still like the music from the original better. The reprise of "Into the Unknown" at the end of the movie is sung by Panic! At the Disco - clearly meant to appeal to the original Frozen fans, who are now tweens and teens.</p>

                        <p class="p_modal">Geronimo Stilton is an Italian children's book series written by Elisabetta Dami (though the covers claim they were written by the title character).[1] On older novels, the copyright is issued to a pseudonym "Geronimo Stilton"; this was changed on newer books. The books are intended for readers in the 8–12 year-old age range. The books are also intended for readers on the N level.

Scholastic Corporation has published the English version of the series in the US since February 2004, and the books are published by Sweet Cherry Publishing in the UK.

The series has sold over 180 millions copies worldwide, and with 249 editions it is one of the best-selling book series ever written.[2] The books have been translated into 49 languages, with more translations to come. [3]

In the series, the title character is an anthropomorphic Dutch-American mouse who lives in the fictional New Mouse City (a probable play on New York City) on fictional Mouse Island. A best-selling author, Geronimo Stilton[4] works as a journalist and editor for the fictional newspaper The Rodent's Gazette.

He has a younger sister named Thea Stilton,[5] a cousin named Trap Stilton,[5] and a favourite nephew, nine-year-old Benjamin Stilton (Ben) and also Petunina Pretty Paws. Geronimo is a nervous, mild-mannered mouse who would like nothing better than to live a quiet life, but he keeps getting involved in faraway adventures with Thea, Trap, and Benjamin, and sometimes Aunt Sweetfur. The books are written as though they are autobiographical adventure stories.<br>

            <p>The wolf (Canis lupus[a]), also known as the gray wolf or grey wolf, is a large canine native to Eurasia and North America. More than thirty subspecies of Canis lupus have been recognized, and gray wolves, as colloquially understood, comprise non-domestic/feral subspecies. The wolf is the largest extant member of the family Canidae, males averaging 40 kg (88 lb) and females 37 kg (82 lb). Wolves measure 105–160 cm (41–63 in) in length and 80–85 cm (31–33 in) at shoulder height. The wolf is also distinguished from other Canis species by its less pointed ears and muzzle, as well as a shorter torso and a longer tail. The wolf is nonetheless related closely enough to smaller Canis species, such as the coyote and the golden jackal, to produce fertile hybrids with them. The banded fur of a wolf is usually mottled white, brown, gray, and black, although subspecies in the arctic region may be nearly all white.</p>
